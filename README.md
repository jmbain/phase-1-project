# Phase 1 Project

## Intro

Welcome to my school data project that leverages the DOE National Center for Education API to do present various cuts of data.

This application currently supports the following functionality:
- Filter by state to present schools that have grown/shrunk the most in terms of student count since the start of the pandemic
- Click on school names to show school-specific data about enrollment

This application will soon support the following functionality:
- Click on school names to show school-specific data about academics and other non-enrollment data
- Filter to specifically show virtual/online/digital schools
- Filter to specifically show district/charter schools
